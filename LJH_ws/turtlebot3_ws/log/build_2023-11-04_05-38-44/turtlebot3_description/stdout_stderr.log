CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/theo/23_HF110/LJH_ws/turtlebot3_ws/build/turtlebot3_description/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/imjunhyung/turtlebot3_ws/build/turtlebot3_description where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/theo/23_HF110/LJH_ws/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/imjunhyung/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
