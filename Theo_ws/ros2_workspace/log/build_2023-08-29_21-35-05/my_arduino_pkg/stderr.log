CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/theo/23_HF110/Theo_ws/ros2_workspace/build/my_arduino_pkg/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/theo/ros2_workspace/build/my_arduino_pkg where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
